# Automaze // Technical Co‑Founder & CTO as a Service

## Got questions? We have the answers

### Frequently asked questions

Why wouldn't I just find a technical co-founder or hire a full-time CTO?

Good question! For starters, the annual cost of a full-time CTO now exceeds $250,000, plus stock options (and good luck finding one available). Not to mention that you’d also have to give up a significant portion of your company for a technical co-founder. The reality is that a full-time CTO is an overkill for most startups, and you probably don’t need one until you have a decent-sized team.

With our service, you get the same expertise and experience at a fraction of the cost without giving away any equity. Furthermore, you can cancel or pause your subscription anytime, so you’re never locked in.

What happens when I sign up?

When you subscribe, you’ll receive an email with a link to your personal task board within one business day. The first task would be signing a confidentiality agreement. We’ll also schedule a call to get to know you and your business and to discuss your first request.

Is there a limit to how many requests I can have?

Once subscribed, you can add as many requests to your queue as you’d like, and they will be handled by us one by one.

How fast will tasks be completed?

It depends on the task and its complexity, but on average, most requests will be completed in 2-3 days.

Who's behind Automaze?

Automaze was founded by Ran Aroussi, a software engineer with over 30 years of experience in various industries. Ran has worked with companies of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprises, and has helped them build and scale their products.

How does the pause feature work?

We understand you may not have enough design work to fill up an entire month. You may only have one or two tasks to perform at the moment. That’s where pausing your subscription comes in handy.

Billing cycles are monthly, based on five days a week or 22 days per month. Let’s say you sign up, use the service for 15 days, and then decide to pause your subscription. This means that the billing cycle will be paused, and you’ll have seven days of service remaining to be used anytime in the future.

What technologies do you work with?

We’ve seen and done it all, but our most common tech stack uses a combination of Node.js, Python, PHP, Bash, Go, React, Vue, Alpine.js, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Postgresql, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GitHub. For UX/UI, we use Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and Photoshop.

How do I put in requests?

When you sign up, you’ll get your dedicated task board, where you’ll be able to add requests, communicate with us, and track the progress of your requests.

Adding a Google doc, wireframes, or recording a brief Loom video is recommended. If it can be linked to or shared in your task board, it’s fair game.

What if I'm not satisfied?

No worries! We'll continue to iterate and revise until you're 100% satisfied.

What if I only have a single request? That’s fine. You can pause your subscription when finished and return when you have additional tasks to perform. There’s no need to let the remainder of your subscription go to waste. Are there any refunds if I don't like the service?

Due to the high quality nature of the work, there will be no refunds issued.
