                      Here’s the thing... 🤔
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Startups don’t fail because of bad code.
                      They fail because they build the wrong thing, at the wrong time, with the wrong approach.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>That’s where we come in.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We’ve been in the trenches. We’ve built platforms that serve millions.
                      We’ve rescued projects from the brink.
                      And yes, we’ve also crashed and burned a few times – which taught us more than any success ever could.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">The Problem With “Normal” Dev Shops</h4>

                    <p>
                      Most agencies work like this: You brief them, they disappear for six weeks, then they deliver
                      something that sort of matches what you asked for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If it breaks? That’s <em><strong>your</strong></em> problem now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Need a small change? That’ll be another project.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We’ve seen this movie too many times. Startups don’t need vendors – they need partners who think like owners, act like team members, and stick around when things get complicated.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">We’re Built Different</h4>

                    <p>
                      <strong class="">We don’t do drive-by development.</strong><br>Every client relationship is long-term by design. We’re not interested in building your MVP and vanishing. We want to be there when you scale to 100,000 users, when you raise your Series A, when you expand to new markets.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>We embed, not just deliver.</strong><br>We join your Slack channels, sync with your project management tools, and work alongside you every single day. Your standups are our standups. Your wins are our wins.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>We’re a partner, not a vendor.</strong><br>No one-off projects. No throwing code over the wall. We form long-term relationships because building great products takes time, iteration, and a deep understanding of your business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>We own outcomes, not outputs.</strong><br>Sure, we write code. But what we really deliver is business success. If your users aren’t happy, we’re not happy. If your metrics aren’t moving, we’re already working on v2.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>We’re proactive.</strong> When we say something will be done, it’s done. When there’s a problem, you’ll know immediately – along with three potential solutions.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">We’re Grown-Ups</h4>

                    <p>
                      We act like the technical co-founder you wish you had. The one who’s been there before, who knows what’s about to break before it does, and who isn’t afraid to tell you when you’re about to make an expensive mistake.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Automaze</strong> was founded by <a href="https://x.com/aroussi" target="_blank" class="font-serif italic tracking-normal group"><img src="https://unavatar.io/ran@automaze.io" class="group-hover:!opacity-90 shadow-md ring-[1.5px] ring-white size-12 -mt-1.5 mr-1 rounded-full" />Ran Aroussi</a>, who has been coding since the late ’80s.
                        He’s built and scaled multiple ventures, created <a href="https://github.com/ranaroussi" target="_blank" class="font-serif italic tracking-normal">open-source tools</a> used by millions, and learned the hard way what actually works in tech. That experience shapes everything we do at Automaze.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Together with <a href="https://x.com/lexburykin" target="_blank">Alex Burykin</a> and <a href="https://x.com/antonboksha" target="_blank">Anton Boksha</a>, who lead our development team, we’ve built a culture where senior expertise meets hands-on execution. They’re in the code, in the architecture discussions, and in your Slack channels, making sure every line of code serves your business goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But this isn’t about our journey. It’s about bringing that hard-won expertise to your team.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">How We Actually Work</h4>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Monthly fee, lifetime relationships.</strong><br>We work on monthly retainers because it keeps us accountable. 92% of our clients have never left and have instead increased and deepened their partnership with us, because we consistently deliver value.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>One team, global coverage.</strong><br>20+ professionals across the UK, Ukraine, Poland, Israel, France, and Germany. While you sleep, we’re shipping. Same standards, same processes, same commitment to excellence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Transparent everything.</strong><br>Clear pricing. Open processes. Constant communication. No black boxes, no surprises, no &quot;trust us, we’re the experts&quot; nonsense.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">What You Actually Get</h4>

                    <p>
                      When you work with Automaze, you’re not hiring contractors. You’re getting:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Strategic thinking:</strong> We challenge assumptions, validate ideas, and help you build what users actually want
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Continuous delivery:</strong> Daily commits, weekly demos, monthly impact – not quarterly surprises
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Full-stack expertise:</strong> Frontend, backend, DevOps, design, product management – all under one roof
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Business partnership:</strong> We think ROI, user retention, and growth metrics – not just clean code
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We become an extension of your team, using your tools, joining your meetings, and caring about your metrics as much as you do.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">Why This Matters</h4>

                    <p>
                      Every startup founder knows the feeling: You need senior technical leadership, but you can’t afford a full-time CTO. You need a reliable development team, but managing freelancers can be a nightmare. You need a product strategy, but agencies don’t understand your business.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      That’s the gap we fill. One partner, one monthly fee, one team that gets it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We’re not the cheapest option. We’re not the biggest agency. And we’re definitely not the ones who’ll tell you everything you want to hear.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      But if you want a technical partner who thinks like a founder, acts like an owner, and delivers like their equity depends on it – we should talk.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="font-bold text-3xl text-black">The Bottom Line</h4>

                    <p>
                      Your product deserves better than another vendor. It deserves a partner who’s been there, done that, and knows what it takes to win.
                    </p>
