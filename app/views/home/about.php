                    Automaze is your <strong>zero-equity technical partner</strong> that thinks like a CTO, delivers like a senior dev squad, and integrates like an internal hire.
                </p>
                <p class="my-4">
                    Whether you’re launching something new or trying to scale what’s already working, we help shape the roadmap, make the right tech choices, and build with a clear path to product-market fit.
                </p>
                <p class="my-4">
                    We don’t sit on the sidelines. <strong>We plug right into your Slack, your code repos, and your project management tools</strong> - so we’re in the loop, in the weeds, and in it with you.
                    No handoffs, no silos, no black boxes. Just a tight feedback loop and a team that treats your startup like their own.
                </p>
                <p class="my-4">
                    <strong>Founders work with us because we make things easier.</strong> No equity asks, no bloated teams, no runaround. Just a flexible monthly retainer that gives you a senior, hands-on crew who knows how to ship, scale, and steer. And we’re here as long as you need us.
                </p>

                <p class="my-4">
                    A real partnership, built for outcomes.
